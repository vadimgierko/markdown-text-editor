# TODO ðŸš€

- [ ] add RWD/ mobile view ðŸ‘‰ additional btn to switch between editor & preview mode
- [ ] check, what is wrong with react-markdown based editor & why it's crashing when partial HTML with inline styles is inputed... OR get rid of it & leave only custom editor which works fine
- [ ] consider adding this editor (after implementing RWD) to all note-taking apps (maybe with some modifications)
