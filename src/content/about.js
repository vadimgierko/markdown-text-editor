export const ABOUT = `<h1 align="center">Welcome to Online Rich Markdown Editor & Renderer</h1>

**Write & test**

- common **Markdown syntax**
- **HTML tags**
- **embed HTML elements**, like video, audio, websites etc.
- **highlighted code blocks**

**& see how it is rendered as an HTML!**

Actually... 😏 you can edit this rendered text right now by editing Markdown on the left! 😎

Or... you can start from scratch [at the editor subpage](/editor), write some Markdown & then save it (automatically in local storage)!
