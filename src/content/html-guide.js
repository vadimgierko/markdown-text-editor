In addition to formatting your notes with Markdown syntax,
you can also use HTML with optional inline CSS styling!

Of course, that requires some basic knowledge of HTML & CSS,
but if you are really motivated to turn your note into complete web page
full of colors, shapes, embed elements and any layout,
than you can learn it online for free pretty fast.

For example:

<p style="text-align: center; background-color: red; color: white;">If you want to have this centered paragraph with red background and white text, you should write this ðŸ‘‡</p>

\`\`\`html
<p style="text-align: center; background-color: red; color: white;">
  If you want to have this centered paragraph with red background and white text, you should write this ðŸ‘‡
</p>
\`\`\`

## Add videos, images &... even the whole websites!

As been mentioned, thanks to ability of using HTML in your notes,
you can also add different embed elements to your note.

For example, you can add... the whole website to your notes by adding this:

\`\`\`markdown
<iframe src="https://www.vadimgierko.com" width="100%" height="500px" title="Linky Notes About Page"></iframe>
\`\`\`

<iframe src="https://www.vadimgierko.com" width="100%" height="500px" title="Linky Notes About Page"></iframe>
